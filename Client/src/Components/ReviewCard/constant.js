        msg: "I had the pleasure of spending a week at the River Trails Camp in April (2024). If I could give a 6th star I would. The accommodations were outstanding, comfortable cooled tents, quick access to the best fishing pools, amazing food both Indian and western, great knowledge of the fish and fishery, views of the confluence pool from my tent porch, and a genuinely great staff.  And don't even get me started on the desserts served after dinner....so good!",

        msg: 'Everyone knows Pancheshwar is a mecca for mahseer but you need to have someone who knows the area intimately and Daniel and his team do. They are also passionate about angling so its the best possible combo. I decided to head out pre monsoon and River Trails accommodated me at very short notice.  Very fortunate to get a 4 pound, a 22lb and a 44lb mahseer in my 2 days there so I couldnt have asked for more. My advice to people going out there is to shut up and listen (Im not one of the people who listens usually because I love to do random fishing stuff that pops into my head) but this time I swallowed my ego, stood on the rock that they told me to and the results are there in the pictures next to this reveiew!!!',

        msg: "Having fished in many remote lodges all around the world, i will say that River Trails of Northern India is a rare one that provides quality service both for fishing as well as accommodation. Daniel Abraham,  the lodge owner is a soft spoken gentleman with lots of knowledge of the Golden Mahseer and will give 200% to help you catch a good fish. His crew is always friendly, approachable, and ready to answer to your needs. By the way, his lodge is the only one in the area that has wifi, and after a long day of fishing, the delicious dinner at lodge and a hot shower thereafter will ensure you sleep like a baby, to be ready for the next day's fishing!",
